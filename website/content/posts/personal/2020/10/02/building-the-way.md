## The IT Wildness

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those, like me, who has been working in IT and having Informatics engineer degree. You may agree how different is the IT engineering profession with the rest of the traditional ones. Due to obvious reasons, like a lack of manpower and the urge to avoid bureaucratic restrictions. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all IT engineers and especially the soft ones, it is needed up to 5 years of study, whoever people with a little experience or even without any scholarship may take your place doing the same tasks. Unfortunately, there are no regulations in the IT engineering field like other professions have. Whereas only Architects can acreditate building constructions or only medics can prescribe medicine, no legal requirement is needed to develop software nor to administrate computer systems. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, you must understand that having a degree diploma won't grant you any success in IT projects, while hands-on experience and purposeful spirit do. In any case the lack of regulation in the IT field isn’t the topic of this text but it’s consequences:

-- technologies are changing faster than the assimilation of them;\
-- the speedup of the delivery constraints ramp up the complexity of the development due to the multiple layers of reliability requirements;\
-- changes are becoming aggressive in order to keep the presence on the market;\
-- team members’ loyalty could be measured by their income because of the continuous burnouts;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My conclusion is that because the Innovation progress concerns everyone and everything, humankind is moving towards it as nothing else would exist!. So, can the IT profession regulation become a blockage for such a mission?. Whatever the answer it would be, I do believe we aren't prepared to estimate the consequences of the world, that is set to that goal, neither to its greatest nor its disgraceful achievements...

## Becoming a freelance

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today I have become a freelance. I stepped out the comfort zone acknowledging the risks of my profession. Far from accepting the status quo, I state that I want to be a fully capable member in the wildness, to assume risks and to do my best in all the fields, not only the tecnical ones.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A day like today is when I have just decided to rush to my destiny in order to open the door to the new opportunities, to embrace the risks hidden beyond the comfortable job place, to be able to make decisions on project battle fields that deserve to fight

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I might be called reckless to make such changes in a current moment like the pandemic one, when there is no clear future can be forecasted... In such moments I say: this is exactly the best moment to do so. It is a gift given to those who are ready to buildup the character, to determine if you are ready to face dificulties, to define the material you are made of. I have commited to that future by saying: I am ready to fight, but above of all, to never surrender.
